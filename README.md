## ✨ Core Features

* **🤖 Magic AI Entry:** Type natural language like *"I spent $45 on pizza with John"* and the Gemini AI engine automatically extracts the amount, categorizes it as "Food & Drink," and calculates the perfect split.
* **🧠 AI Financial Advisor:** The backend dynamically calculates your out-of-pocket spending across categories and generates personalized, contextual financial insights using Gemini 2.5 Flash.

* **👤 Unified Ledger:** Seamlessly handles complex group splits, 1-on-1 friend debts, and solitary "Personal Only" expenses in a single, high-performance database schema.
* **📊 Real-Time Telemetry:** Dashboard features interactive SVG charts (`recharts`) and instant net-balance calculations.
